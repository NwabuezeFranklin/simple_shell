shell [option_name] [argument ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
shell is a command programming language that executes commands read from a terminal or a file. It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system.
.SH INVOCATION
If no arguments are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a terminal, the shell is considered an interactive shell.
.PP
If the standard input is used with a pipeline operator, |, to connect the command, such as echo "qwerty" | ./shell, then the shell is in non-interactive mode.
.SH LEXICAL STRUCTURE
The shell reads input in terms of lines from a file and breaks it up into words at whitespace (blanks and tabs).
.SH RETURN
Upon successful return, the shell will always return a 0 for success. If the shell program fails when a command is entered incorrectly or does not exist in the $PATH, then shell program will exit out of the child process and display an error message corresponding to the error the user committed and return with a prompt.
.SH BUILT-INS
